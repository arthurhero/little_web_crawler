To start using our search engine, follow these steps:
1. Find the variable "seed_url" in the code file "webcrawler.py", and set this variable to an url of a page.
   Think of this url as the starting point of our search engine - this url will be the first page that our search engine crawls.
2. Find the variable "crawl_num" (which should be immediately below "seed_url" in the code).
   Set it to a number of desired. This number will be the upper limit for the number of crawled pages.
3. Run the code file. If you are running it for the first time, wait for the search engine crawling web pages. Then you will be prompted to enter your query.
   If you are running it not for the first time, wait for the search engine parsing existing data files (files for recording documents, indices, etc.). Then you will be prompted to enter your query.
